# Linear Algebra

## Dot Product

- It's also sometimes called `scalar product` because output of dot product is a single number
- Dot product is distributive
  - `a^(T)(b + c) = a^(T)b + a^(T)c` where all are vectors
- Dot product is not associative
  - `a^(T)(b^(T)c) != (a^(T)b)^(T)c`
  - Bur matrix multiplication is associative!
  - `A(B C) = (A B)C`
- In algebra
  - `sum of a_i * b_i`
- In geometry
  - `cos(theta between a and b) * |a| * |b|`

## Vector length

- Also called magnitude or norm
- Square root of dot product of the same vector.
