# Math

## Linear Algebra

- Physics and engineering people tend to describe a vector in the bold or normal font, or underline it.
- Math and computer science people don't tend to do that.
- Size of vector
  - Dot itself and take square root
  - `r.r = |r|^2`, then take square root, `sqrt(|r|^2) = |r|`
- `Modulus`
  - The length of a vector
