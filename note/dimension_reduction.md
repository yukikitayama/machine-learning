### t-SNE

- Maybe pronounce it "tee-snee".
- `t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding`
- Project data into a low dimensional space so that the clustering in the high dimensional space is preserved.
    - e.g. You can see clusters in 2D scatter plot, apply t-SNE, even in 1D number line, preserve the same clusters.
