# Separating Hyperplane

- `Perceptrons`
  - Compute a linear combination fo the input features and return the sign as a classifier.
  - Foundation for the neural network

## Rosenblatt's Perceptron Learning Algorithm

- Find a separating hyperplane by minimizing the distance of misclassified points to the decision boundary.
- Use `stochastic gradient descent` to minimize the linear criterion.
- Converges to a separating hyperplane if the classes are linearly separable.
