    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing typically measures\n",

    "- Number of clicks\n",
    "- Number of purchases\n",
    "- Duration of seeing web apges\n",

    "## Multiple A/B tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can. But we cannot purely run the A/B tests multiple times. We need to consider the following.\n",

    "### Bonferroni correction (adjustment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide significance level $\\alpha$ by the number of multiple test $n$, so $\\frac{\\alpha}{n}$\n",

    "## Compute sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute sample size if we have **effect size**, **power**, and **significance level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **effect size** is the amount of change we hope to have with a new feature. For example, with a new feature, if we want the click rate to increase by 10%, the 10% is the effect size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **power** is the probability of detecting the effect size in A/B testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **significance level** is the probability of incorrectly saying we have the effect when the effect actually doesn't exist.\n",

    "  - Selecting a test statistic after an experiment, but the test statistic needs to be established beforehand. \n",
