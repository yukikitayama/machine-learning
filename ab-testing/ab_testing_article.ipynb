    "# A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists sometimes need to do experiments about user interface in web design and product marketing. A/B testing is a common approach to test the hypothesis. For example, whether a new interface B is better than the existing interface A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control group** is a standard, existing, without-new-things group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treatment group (Test group)** is a group with a new feature or a specific thing we want to test. \n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing typically measures, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of clicks\n",
    "- Number of purchases\n",
    "- Duration of seeing web apges\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis test\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that A/B testing usually establishes. When we see difference between A and B, the hypothesis test will tell us *whether it's due to random chance or true difference*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing typically uses **one-way** hypothesis test (**one-tail** hypothesis test). One-way hypothesis test treats one group as default and test whether the other group is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-test** and **t-test** are hypothesis test. Both are the *same* in the following points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide if the **mean** from the sample is different from a certain value (or more than a value, or less than a value)\n",
    "- Assume the samples follow a **normal distribution**.\n",
    "- Use the same test statistic below. $s$ is the standard deviation. $n$ is the sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\hat{\\mu} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But they are *different* in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test uses **standard normal distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "t-test uses **t-distribution**. It has **degrees of freedom**. As it gets large, t-distribution gets closer to standard normal distribution. When the sample size is small, t-test is more appropriate than Z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type I error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type II error\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random permutation test\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization test, resampling permutation procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When samples don't follow a normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple A/B tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can. But we cannot purely run the A/B tests multiple times. We need to consider the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonferroni correction (adjustment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide significance level $\\alpha$ by the number of multiple test $n$, so $\\frac{\\alpha}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### F-test\n",
    "\n",
    "xxx\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-arm bandit\n",
    "\n",
    "xxx\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compute sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute sample size if we have **effect size**, **power**, and **significance level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **effect size** is the amount of change we hope to have with a new feature. For example, with a new feature, if we want the click rate to increase by 10%, the 10% is the effect size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **power** is the probability of detecting the effect size in A/B testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **significance level** is the probability of incorrectly saying we have the effect when the effect actually doesn't exist.\n",
