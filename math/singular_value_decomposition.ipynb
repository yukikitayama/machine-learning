    "SVD is similar to Eigendecomposition, but SVD is more general because it works on a rectangular matrix as well as a square matrix. Eigendecomposition only works for a square matrix. There are ways to think. Think eigendecomposition is a special case of SVD. Or think SVD is an extension of eigendecomposition.\n",
