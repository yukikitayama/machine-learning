    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A team wants to A/B test multiple different changes through a sign-up funnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, on a page, a button is currently red and at the top of the page. They want to see if changing a button from red to blue and/or from the top of the page to the bottom of the page will increase click-through.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you set up this test?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 2 variables to test button color and button location. We want to have a test that tells us an interaction effect of the 2 variables. There are the following 4 variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red button at the top\n",
    "- Red button at the bottom\n",
    "- Blue button at the top\n",
    "- Blue button at the bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "More variants increase the variance of the results. To set up this test, we should have a **long duration of time of the test** to reduce the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also possible to set up a chain of the A/B tests. First, we run the color change test for a certain duration of time, and then run the location change test afterward. But this can't observe the interaction effect. For example, if blue is better, and then top is better, we won't know whether red top is better than blue top.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to compute the **sample size**. Multiply the **number of page visitors** per day in each variant by the **number of days** to run a test to reach a certain **significance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each page visitor needs to be assigned to one of variants to remove bias."
