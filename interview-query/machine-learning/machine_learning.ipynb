    "Suppose we have a binary classification model that classifies whether or not an applicant should be qualified to get a loan. Because we are a financial company, we have to provide each rejected applicant with a reason why. Given we donâ€™t have access to the feature weights, how would we give each rejected applicant a reason why they got rejected?\n",

    "Create **partial dependence plot** for each feature and find the value in a feature which increases the probability of default, and explain to applicants that their input to a certain feature possibly was the reason for rejection."
