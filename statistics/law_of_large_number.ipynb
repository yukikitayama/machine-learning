    "This means that, $n$ is the number of experiment repetitions, not the sample size. Even if the sample size is the same in each repetition, when the number of repetitions gets larger. $\\bar{x}_n$ means the average of all the $n$ sample means. $\\mu$ is the true population mean which we typically don't know. By taking the absolute, we wanna know how far off from the true. $\\epsilon$ means arbitrary small number still greater than 0. So the entire thing means that **probability of the divergence between the average of sample means and true mean greater than 0 is approaching 0**. So as we have more repetition, the divergence gets better.\n",
