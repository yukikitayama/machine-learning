    "## K-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-means clustering** attempts to minimize within-group distances and maximize between-group distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's difficult to know the proper $k$ a priori.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Silhouette test** measures quality of clustering, \n",
    "\n",
    "The more clusters we have, the sum of squared distances between each data and centroid will be smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "## dbscan\n",
    "\n",
    "**dbscan** stands for **density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a **distance parameter**, for each data, check whether there is any data within a distance from the data. If nothing is nearby, this data is to be noise. If there is any, they will be a cluster. Then by using the **minimum number of data points parameter**, determine which data belongs to which cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epsilon** $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step size for finding clusters. Radius distance around a data point.\n",
    "- Too small -> clusters broken up into many clusters.\n",
    "- Too large -> separate clusters combined into one\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically use **eucledian distance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum points**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum number of data points to be a cluster\n",
    "- Too small -> many small clusters\n",
    "- Too large -> true small clusters ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\epsilon$ is sensitive to the scale of the data. For example, if we normalize the data, we need to find another $\\epsilon$ which fits the normalized data.\n",

    "- **Global** distances\n",
    "- Users specify **number of clusters**, and algorithm determines **distance thresholds**\n",
