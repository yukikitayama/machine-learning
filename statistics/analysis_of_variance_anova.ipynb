    "The goal is to determine the effects of **discrete** independent variables on a **continuous** dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly we are concerned with main effect of a factor and interactions between factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main effect** is one factor which influences the dependent variable even when ignoring all other factors. For example, young people's symptoms improve faster than older people's symptoms, regardless of medication type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactions** are the effect of one factor depends on the levels of another factor. For example, medication A works better in older people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intercept** is when the average dependent variable is different from 0, but the intercept of the ANOVA is usually **ignored**. For example, symptoms improve for almost everyone after 10 days.\n",
