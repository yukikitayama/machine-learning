    "We have null hypothesis $H_0$ distribution and alternative hypothesis $H_A$ value, and how likely is the $H_A$ value to occur if $H_0$ is true?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the probability of observing a parameter estimate of $H_A$ or larger, given that there is no true effect, meaning if we retain the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability in these statements is $P(H_A | H_0).\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot prove that $H_A$ is true. We can only compute the probability that the test statistic associated with $H_A$ could be observed **given that there is no true effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "P-values are probabilities, ranging from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- P-values closer to 0, low probability of $H_A | H_0$, so $H_0$ is not true. \n",
    "- P-values closer to 1, high probability of $H_A | H_0$, so $H_0$ is true.\n",

    "## Compute p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "The ways to compute a p-value depend on the specific statistical test and assumptions made.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Statistical significance** is the probability of observing a test statistic this large given that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistically significant if the test statistic is greater than a threshold, so $p(H_A) < p(\\alpha)$\n",

    "Hypotheses should be as specific as possible, so should use **one-tailed**, but in practice, statistical tests are nearly always done **two-tailed**.\n",
